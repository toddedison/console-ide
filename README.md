Vim/Tmux Config
===============

Assumes `*NIX` system and prior installation of `vim` and `tmux`.

* Adds preconfigured `.vimrc` and `.tmux.conf` files to `$USER` home directory.
* Clones plugin repos into `~/.vim/bundles/`.
* Appends script into `~/.bashrc` splitting console to 4 panes (for dev).

Gotchas
-------

* Tmux key combo rebinded to `Ctrl->a`.
* If "updating", will need to edit `~/.bashrc` manually.
